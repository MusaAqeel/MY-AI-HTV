## Inspiration
One thing the pandemic has taught us was the severity of mental health and how crucial it is to have someone to talk to during hardships. We believe in using technology to create a solution that addresses mental health, a global issue of utmost importance in today's world. As high school students, we constantly face stress and emotional challenges that significantly impact our lives. We often want help to get out of a hard situation, however; the help we receive, such as a therapist and a list of non-profit help lines, isn't usually the help that we want such as someone to talk to. 

## What it does
My-AI is a chatbot that has a one-on-one conversation with the user in a way that is comforting and helpful by providing emotional support and advice. Maiya, the AI chatbot, assesses the user's messages and feelings to generate a human-like response so the user feels as if they are talking to another human, more so to a friend; a friend without bias and judgement. The entire conversation is not saved and so deleted once the user finishes the conversation.

## How we built it
We prototyped on Figma and then developed the front end with React. Our backend was created using Java Script to made the node server, which is responsible for calling the API.

## Challenges we ran into
Our team ran into many problems as it was one of the first hackathons that most of our team members attended. In terms of front-end development, none of our team members had experience in React so building a website within a time constraint was a learning curve. Other problems we faced in the backend were issues with the API as it would not respond sometimes, the accuracy was off, and wasn't doing what we needed it to do. Finally, we had trouble connecting the back end to the front end.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
One thing our whole team is most proud of is our skillset improvement in React. All members experienced using React for the first time so navigating an issue for us helped us grasp a better understanding of it. We are also extremely proud of the fine-tuning of the API to meet our project's demands. 

## What we learned
We mainly enhanced our skills in React and how to implement and fine-time an API.

## What's next for My-AI
The more Maya is trained with people and different experiences obtained through the chat box, the more accurate the support is.
